# tgbot_troposcatter
Troposcatter trace calculator

Bot is available as Troposcatter_bot in Telegram

Bot is running on free server https://eu.pythonanywhere.com/, so it may work slowly sometimes.

This telegram bot was created for calculating troposcatter trace parameters, but, mostly, as education project (that's my first experience in Python).
It's useful for guidance station antennas at two sites on azimuth between them. Also, bot calculate horizon close angle (HCA) and trace profile between sites.

For tropo station Groza-1.5 it calculates losses and estimated median speed on trace.

Bot supports almost any input formats for sites coordinates.

And watch your language, please. Bot may be a little pique.
