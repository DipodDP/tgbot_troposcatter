# tgbot_troposcatter
Troposcatter trace calculator

Bot is available as Troposcatter_bot in Telegram

Bot is running on free server https://eu.pythonanywhere.com/, so it may working slowly sometimes.

This telegram bot was created for calculating troposcatter trace parameters, but, mostly as education project (that's my first expirience in in Python).
It's useful for guidance station antennas at two sites on azimuth between them. Also bot calculate horizon close angle (HCA) and trace profile between sites.

For tropo station Groza-1.5 it calculate losses and approximate speed rate on trace.

Bot supports almost any input formats for sites coordinates.
